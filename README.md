# BugBountyFramework
=========================

# This is my framework for bug bounty recon and manual testing. 

# This includes my notes on different vulnerability classes, personal payload lists and testing tools that I personally use in my workflow.

goals {
  - Centralise recon, testing, and reporting in one workflow
  - Run pre-testing tools (e.g. ffuf, nmap) with one command
  - Maintain clean notes and personal payloads
};

preTestingTools() {
  ffuf         = Fuzz for hidden endpoints, files, parameters, subdomains, etc.
  subfinder    = Fast passive subdomain enumeration
  amass        = Active and passive asset discovery
  httpx        = Probes HTTP(S) URLs and gathers metadata
  nmap         = Scan for open ports, services, versions
  waybackurls  = Pull archived URLs from Wayback Machine
  gau          = Extract known URLs from public sources
  dnsx         = DNS resolution for large sets of domains
  katana       = Crawler for JavaScript endpoints and more
  uncover      = Fetch IPs using public search engines
